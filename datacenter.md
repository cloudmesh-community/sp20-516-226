# Data Center HID: sp20-516-226

## Facebook Altoona Data Center Details (E.Datacenter.2.b)

This data center was first announced in 2013, and is over 2.5 million square feet [@altoonadc-sp20-516-226]. Facebook has 
spent over $1 billion on creating and improving the data center. As of 2019, the center also employed over 300 people. The 
center recycles or composts 52 percent of its waste [@facebook-sp20-516-226]. This is the equivalent of almost 170 tons of waste. During the planning 
stages of the project, the plan was to have the center run on 100% wind power [@altoonawind-sp20-516-220]. However, as it has expanded this has changed.
Facebook is now working with local utility companies to create solar grids to aid in powering their data center [@expansion-sp20-516-226].


## Solar Power (E.Datacenter.4)

### What is solar power?

Solar power is considered a renewable resource because it takes advantage of energy from the sun. Solar panels utilize 
 photovoltaic cells to convert the energy from the sun into a useful form of energy for every day use [@solarinfo-sp20-516-226]. 
 Solar power is a fairly attractive alternative option for data centers for a number of reasons. For one, solar is relatively
  cheap. There is a steep initial cost, but after that point solar panels are easy and cheap to maintain. In a similar vain,
   the cost of solar energy does not fluctuate as much as the cost for resources such as natural gas or coal [@solarpower-sp20-516-226].

 ### Data Centers Utilizing This Energy Source

 * Aiso.net
    * This solar-powered data center is located in Texas. By Aiso.net's calculations, one year of use of their solar panels 
    eliminates thousands of pounds of CO2, one hundred pounds of Nitrogen oxide, and nearly one hundred pounds of sulfate 
    from entering the atmosphere [@aiso-sp20-516-226].
 * Google
    * Google has built two large solar farms in Alabama and Tennessee to supply power to their nearby data centers [@googlesolar-sp20-516-226]. 
 * Amazon
    * Amazon has built six solar farms in Virginia that are being used to power data centers. They are also building new 
    solar farms. 

## Amazon's Efforts Toward Data Center Sustainability (E.Datacenter.5)

Amazon has made a commitment to ensuring that all energy used by them and their data centers will come from a renewable 
source. In order to achieve this, Amazon has begun to build out its own renewable infrastructure. As of now, Amazon has
built facilities to produce energy via:

* Solar Power
    * Amazon has six solar farms in Virginia
* Wind
    * Amazon has three wind farms in different areas of the United States
   
In addition to these facilities, Amazon has announced that it is in the process of constructing an additional solar farm,
as well as four new wind farms. Because of the infrastructure they have built out, Amazon has made great progress in this
area. In 2018, over half of the power consumed by AWS data centers came from a renewable source[@amazonsus-sp20-516-226].


## Facebook Server Outage (E.Datacenter.8)

### What happened?

In March of 2019, Facebook servers experienced issues for 14-hours [@facebookserver-sp20-516-226]. Facebook has several services linked, so issues
affected multiple services, including Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. 
According to Facebook, the cause of the issue was an error in the configuration of their servers.

### Impact

This problem occurred globally, and very likely
affected the majority of Facebook's 2.3 billion users, as well as users of the other services. In addition to affecting 
users of the services, this incident also affected the ad-buying system used by Facebook [@facebookoutage-sp20-516-226]. Facebook's ad revenue is estimated
to have been $250 million in 2019. Therefore, losing a day's worth of ad revenue could have cost the company over $500 thousand [@fbservers-sp20-516-226].
Additionally, Facebook's shares decreased by 1.6 percent on the day of the incident.
